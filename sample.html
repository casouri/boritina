    <h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>
    <p>
      The Pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back
      upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the
      congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the
      chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the
      whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a
      sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had
      dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,
      Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort
      of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for
      among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild
      gleams of a newly developing bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth
      even beneath February’s snow.  No one having previously heard his
      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the
      utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
      peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
      he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
      and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran
      down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed
      almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had
      absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one
      removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,
      arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
      floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
      architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
      finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
      side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
      The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome
      pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself
      nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole
      contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no
      means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the
      ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
      man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
      sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted
      the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
      with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were
      of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first
      glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient
      for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
      For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,
      slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up
      the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving
      him impregnable in his little Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
      sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
      mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober
      reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something
      unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he
      signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
      worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and
      wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is
      a self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a
      perennial well of water within the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
      borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings.  Between the marble
      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its
      back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship
      beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and
      snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling
      clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed
      forth an angel’s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of
      radiance upon the ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver
      plate now inserted into the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell.  “Ah,
      noble ship,” the angel seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble
      ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the
      clouds are rolling off—serenest azure is at hand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
      had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in
      the likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
      projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s
      fiddle-headed beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this
      earth’s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit
      leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is
      first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From
      thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for
      favourable winds.  Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not
      a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 10
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Bosom Friend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
      quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
      time.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on
      the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face
      that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
      jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
      himself in his heathenish way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,
      going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his
      lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every
      fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly
      around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of
      astonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming
      to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count
      more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties
      being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages
      was excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and
      hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his
      countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means
      disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly
      tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and
      in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of
      a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,
      there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his
      uncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had
      never cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,
      that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
      brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,
      this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
      phrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it
      reminded me of General Washington’s head, as seen in the popular
      busts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
      from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
      long promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George
      Washington cannibalistically developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to
      be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
      presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
      appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
      book.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the
      night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had
      found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this
      indifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at
      times you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are
      overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a
      Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at
      all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made
      no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the
      circle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;
      yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.
      Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of
      Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown
      among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet
      Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
      utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to
      himself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt
      he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to
      be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living
      or so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives
      himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
      old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
      mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it
      then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms
      gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
      solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began
      to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more
      my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish
      world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very
      indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized
      hypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights
      to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.
      And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were
      the very magnets that thus drew me.  I’ll try a pagan friend, thought
      I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew
      my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my
      best to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these
      advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night’s
      hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
      bedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
      perhaps a little complimented.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
      him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
      that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
      went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
      be seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
      producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And
      then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping
      it regularly passing between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
      left us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
      unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
      forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
      henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we
      were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.
      In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed
      far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple
      savage those old rules would not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
      together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
      enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
      thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
      mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of
      them towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;
      but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets.  I let
      them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his
      idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and
      symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well
      knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case
      he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
      Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator
      in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.
      Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
      earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an
      insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is
      worship?—to do the will of God—THAT is worship.  And what is the
      will of God?—to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man
      to do to me—THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow
      man.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,
      unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
      Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
      idolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent
      little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before
      him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and
      went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.
      But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for
      confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,
      there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old
      couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,
      then, in our hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving
      pair.
